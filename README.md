## 🎯 Objective

The primary objectives of this project are:

- 🔍 Clean and preprocess the dataset for analysis.
- 📊 Visualize trends in coffee sales using:
  - **Python**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
  - **Power BI**: Interactive and dynamic dashboard
- ⏳ Analyze seasonal sales trends.
- 💳 Understand customer payment behavior.
- ☕ Identify top-selling coffee products and average spend per season.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python Libraries**:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for static plots
  - `plotly` for interactive visualizations
- **Power BI** for professional, interactive dashboards
- **Jupyter Notebook** for EDA scripting

---

## 📈 Key Visualizations (Python)

- Sales trend over time (`money` vs `date`)
- Coffee-wise sales frequency
- Seasonal sales distribution
- Count of payment types
- Average transaction amount by season



## 🔍 Insights Summary

- **"Americano with Milk"** is the top-selling coffee.
- **Spring** shows the highest average transaction amount.
- **Card payments** are overwhelmingly more popular than cash.
